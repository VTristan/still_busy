A piece of code in C.
The goal is to always keep your window active.
For example, in Microsoft Teams, your status will always be "busy" thanks to this program.

How to run it:
For those who don't have a C compiler, I provide the .exe and a batch.

Now all you have to do is change the name of your Microsoft Teams window to busy.bat.
Then double-click on the file, the program will launch and then do what you want!

How it works :
The program detects if you haven't used your keyboard or mouse for more than 50 seconds.
If so, the window will be displayed in full screen, then a message will be sent to you pretending that you are using your keyboard. But there is nothing!

Remarks:
-To enable debug mode,  put a 1 as the 2nd command-line-argument
-CTRL + C to stop the program.
